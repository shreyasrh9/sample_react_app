This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

#Sample React App

I searched for a rest api which gave me the info of ecommerce products over the internet so that I just call the service using axious and get the json content of the details of the products.

I founded http://webhose.io/product-data-api provided the required information.

I tried to use webhose api but I ran into "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource‚Äù. I thought of resolving the issue by the help of https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/. 
But, I founded another website which is a fake json placeholder https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. Here the ecommerce products api was not there but other api likes blog posts, comments, photos etc was available. So I chose to use posts api.

I tried hosting this project on github pages by following https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master.

But there was some version issues and I didn't wanted to change the versions as it might affect my current running projects.
